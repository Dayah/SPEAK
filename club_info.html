The SPEAK/SGA recycling program needs your help!<br>
<br>
 As you may well be aware of, S.P.E.A.K., the SGA, and the Physical Plant<br>
are in the process of revamping the recycling program at UT. In<br>
previous years, material collected in the large outside bins behind<br>
Greve/Massey and Presidential often became contaminated with trash and<br>
non-recyclable material. When contamination occurs, the entire bin of<br>
recycling is simply taken to a landfill.  Beginning in September 2001<br>
the bins were open for limited times during the day and staffed with<br>
volunteers to prevent contamination.  All materials placed in the bins<br>
have been recycled since the revamping of the program.<br>
<br>
The recycling bins will reopen after the semester break on Sunday,<br>
January 13th. The bins will be open Sunday thru Thursday from 5:00pm<br>
until dusk. After day light savings time, the bin hours will be<br>
extended from 5:00- 7:00pm. The remainder of the time the bins will<br>
remain locked. Volunteers are needed to help make sure that only<br>
recyclable materials are place in thebins. Monitoring the bins is<br>
extremely easy, and information will be given to the volunteers about<br>
which materials can and cannot be placed in each bin. Most of the time<br>
 recycling drop off is slow and the volunteer(s) can study, etc..<br>
<br>
This program can only work with help from students and organizations<br>
across campus. If your organization would like to help with this<br>
project, please contact SPEAK at <a href="mailto:speak@utk.edu">speak@utk.edu</a> or Sarah Surak at<br>
<a href="ssurak@utk.edu">ssurak@utk.edu</a>. Our goal is to have different student organizations<br>
sign up for two days a month to provide people to monitor the bins. For<br>
example, if an organization chooses the first two Monday's of every<br>
month to volunteer at the Greve bins, they will need provide volunteers<br>
for these two days every month until May.<br>
