<B>Eight Years of Eco-Activism</B>
<BR>
Over the years, a number of student environmental groups had come and gone on the campus of the University of
Tennessee at Knoxville. Then, in 1993, a student named Mary Anne Peine -- with the help of Michele Case, Steve
Hixon, and others -- became a driving force in establishing SPEAK.<BR>
<BR>
Peine founded SPEAK as an activist group to promote sustainable living at UT and in the region. The group is
non-hierarchical in social structure and attracts students from all disciplines of study. Dr. Mike McKinney of
the geology department has served as SPEAK's faculty advisor from the beginning.<BR>

<BR>
In the fall of 1994, SPEAK organized a peaceful demonstration at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant to draw attention
to safety violations and cost overruns. The demonstration attracted over 300 people and recevied national media
attention, including coverage by CNN, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and all regional media.<BR>
<BR>
In the October 1996 issue of Mother Jones magazine, UT was listed as one of the top twenty activist campuses in
the nation, from 1976-1996. This was due entirely to the work of SPEAK.<BR>
<BR>
Every year since 1993, SPEAK has hosted the annual campus Earth Week festivities. Earth Week has grown each
year, and will continue to be an important educational opportunity for the campus community in years to come.<BR>
<BR>
During Earth Week 1995, Greenpeace brought it's solar truck, Cyrus, to campus, where it fueled a solar powered
concert (on a rainy day, at that!). In 1997, SPEAK hosted a music festival on the "Greenway."<BR>
<BR>
SPEAK has played, and will continue to play, a role in environmental education for the campus community. The
group has hosted speakers from across the U.S. and Canada who have made presentations on a wide variety of
environmental issues.<BR>
<BR>
SPEAK has always been a prominent chapter in S.E.A.C. (Student Environmental Action Coalition), the largest
student-run environmental organization in the nation.<BR>
<BR>
In the spring of '98, SPEAK spearheaded a recycled paper purchasing referendum passed in the student government
elections. The group has also worked with Foundation for Global Sustainability over the years.<BR>
<BR>
Other projects include chip mill protests, protests at the paper mill at Canton, NC, many letter writing
campaigns for many issues, participating in the Turkey Creek wetland development protest and the Falls Creek
Falls stripmining protest.
