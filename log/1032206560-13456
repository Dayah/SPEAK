It seems that our new president here at UT has requested that everything be removed from the hallways of campus buildings.  there was an email that was sent to faculty requesting that things be removed promptly.  well...i guess that includes recycling containers.  just try finding one around campus.  i spoke with a janitor for one of the buildings and he told me that they were instructed to remove all recycling containers as of friday the 13th of september.  this is a big step in the wrong direction for the new administration.
