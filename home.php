Welcome to the web site for SPEAK (Students Promoting Environmental
Action in Knoxville). We meet every Wednesday during the school year in
the University Center at 8:00 pm, on the campus of the University
of Tennessee at Knoxville.
<p>
We work to increase awareness with regards to environmental issues,
and seek creative solutions to local problems. In the spirit of thinking
globally and acting locally we stress action, and the concepts of stewardship
and sustainability, so if this sounds reasonable to you, please join us
to be a part of the solution.
